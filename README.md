## Description
Telemetry Portal is a robust web application designed to streamline the management of projects and clients. Built with Blazor and ASP.NET Core, it leverages modern web technologies to offer an intuitive interface for CRUD operations on project and client data. The application supports efficient project tracking and client management, providing valuable insights into time and cost savings. With seamless integration for reporting through Power BI, Telemetry Portal enables users to visualize and analyze data effectively. By adopting the repository pattern, the application ensures clean and maintainable code, making it a reliable tool for organizations looking to enhance their project and client management processes.

## How the app is used
Upon accessing Telemetry Portal through your web browser, users are greeted with a clean and user-friendly interface designed for efficient project and client management. The application is divided into intuitive sections that allow users to manage their data with ease.

### Managing Projects
All project-related activities are centralized on the "Projects" page. Users can see a detailed list of all active projects here, complete with important information like the project name, description, creation date, status, and related client ID. Users only need to click the "Create" button to add a new project; this will take them to a form where they can enter all the necessary information. The action links that are provided next to each project entry can be used to amend or delete existing projects. This simplified method guarantees that users can manage their project data effectively and make the required additions or deletions.

### Managing Clients
In a comparable manner, the "Clients" page offers a thorough summary of every client record. Important client data, such as name, primary email address, and onboarding date, is visible to users. The "Create" button leads visitors to a form where they can enter customer details, making the process of adding a new client simple. By using the action links given, users can also manage current clients by adding, removing, or modifying records. This feature guarantees that all client data is accurate and up to date while facilitating efficient client management.

### Creating and editing records
Users are guided through simple forms where they can enter or change details when creating or amending records. This covers information related to projects, such as the name, description, status, and client ID. Users will provide client information such name, email address, and onboarding date. Prior to submission, validation and error handling make sure that all needed fields are accurately completed.

### Viewing and Analyzing Data
Power BI and Telemetry Portal are integrated for enhanced data analysis and reporting. Reports that offer insights into client and project data, including time and cost savings, can be created and viewed by users. This feature improves the application's overall usefulness by assisting users in making decisions based on thorough data visualizations.
